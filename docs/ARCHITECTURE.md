# Reliability Module Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the Reliability and Maintenance Analysis System. The system is designed to provide tools for asset management, reliability analysis, and maintenance optimization using Weibull distribution, RCM principles, and Monte Carlo simulation.

## Data Flow 

1. **User Interface (React Components)**
   - Provides forms for data input 
   - Displays analysis results, charts, and visualizations
   - Handles user interactions
   - Manages navigation between different modules

2. **API Layer (Express Routes)**
   - Validates incoming requests
   - Enforces authorization rules
   - Routes requests to appropriate services/engines
   - Returns formatted responses

3. **Calculation Engines (Reliability Modules)**
   - Performs Weibull reliability analysis
   - Optimizes maintenance intervals
   - Implements RCM methodology
   - Runs Monte Carlo simulations
   - Validates calculation parameters
   - Handles calculation errors

4. **Data Access Layer (Storage Interface)**
   - Provides CRUD operations for assets, maintenance events, etc.
   - Implements consistent interface for storage operations
   - Abstracts database implementation details

5. **Database (In-Memory/PostgreSQL)**
   - Stores assets, maintenance events, failure modes 
   - Maintains user data and permissions
   - Persists analysis results (optional)

## Key Modules and Their Functions

### 1. Asset Management Module
- Manages asset information (ID, name, description, criticality)
- Stores Weibull parameters for each asset
- Tracks installation date, location, and operational status

### 2. Weibull Analysis Module
- Calculates reliability function R(t)
- Determines failure rate function Î»(t)
- Estimates Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Visualizes reliability, failure rate, and probability curves

### 3. Maintenance Optimization Module
- Calculates total maintenance cost based on PM interval
- Determines optimal preventive maintenance interval
- Analyzes cost-benefit tradeoffs
- Recommends maintenance strategy based on reliability parameters

### 4. RCM Analysis Module
- Evaluates asset criticality and failure predictability
- Analyzes failure modes and consequences
- Recommends appropriate maintenance strategy
- Provides specific task recommendations

### 5. Simulation Module
- Performs Monte Carlo simulation of failures and maintenance
- Estimates average costs and number of failures
- Analyzes failure time distribution
- Compares different maintenance strategies

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/assets` | GET | Get all assets |
| `/api/assets` | POST | Create new asset |
| `/api/assets/:id` | GET | Get specific asset |
| `/api/assets/:id` | PUT | Update asset |
| `/api/assets/:id` | DELETE | Delete asset |
| `/api/weibull-analysis` | POST | Perform Weibull analysis |
| `/api/maintenance-optimization` | POST | Optimize maintenance interval |
| `/api/rcm-analysis` | POST | Perform RCM analysis |
| `/api/simulation` | POST | Run Monte Carlo simulation |
| `/api/maintenance-events` | GET | Get all maintenance events |
| `/api/assets/:id/maintenance-events` | GET | Get maintenance events for asset |
| `/api/failure-modes` | GET | Get all failure modes |
| `/api/assets/:id/failure-modes` | GET | Get failure modes for asset |

## Error Handling 

The system implements structured error handling with these error types:

| Error Type | Description | HTTP Code |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| VALIDATION_ERROR | Invalid input parameters | 400 |
| AUTHORIZATION_ERROR | Insufficient permissions | 403 |
| RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND | Requested resource doesn't exist | 404 |
| DATA_CONFLICT | Data consistency issue | 409 |
| CALCULATION_ERROR | Error in reliability calculations | 500 |
| SERVER_ERROR | General server error | 500 |

## Performance Considerations

For computationally intensive operations:
- Weibull analysis is optimized for time horizons up to 10,000 time units
- Monte Carlo simulations should be limited to 10,000 runs
- All chart data is dynamically calculated with appropriate data point sampling for visualization
- Calculation modules use efficient algorithms to minimize processing time

## Security Model

The system implements role-based access control:
- Admins: Full access to all features and data
- Analysts: Can perform analysis and create assets, but not delete data
- Technicians: Can update asset information and view reports
- Viewers: Read-only access to analysis reports
