Here’s how you can organize formal FMECA sheets for both Individual Asset-Level and System-Level analyses. I'll outline the suggested structure, ensuring clarity and completeness for your needs:
Sheet 1: Individual Asset-Level FMECA
This sheet focuses on a specific asset. Here's the structure:
Header Information (Top of the Sheet)
Field	Details
Tag Number	Unique identifier for the asset (e.g., Pump-101).
Asset Description	Brief description of the asset (e.g., Centrifugal Pump).
Function	What the asset does in the process (e.g., Delivers fluid to main system).
FMECA Table (Bottom of the Sheet)
Component	Failure Mode	Cause	Effect	Severity	Probability	Detection	RPN	Action Required	Target Date	Comments/Notes
Mechanical Seal	Leakage	Wear and tear	Fluid leakage, operational halt	8	6	3	144	Replace seals periodically	01-May-2025	Monitor wear during inspections
Bearing	Excessive vibration	Misalignment	Increased noise, overheating	7	5	4	140	Align and lubricate bearings	10-May-2025	Use predictive maintenance
Shaft	Cracking	Material fatigue	Total pump failure	10	3	5	150	Conduct fatigue tests	20-May-2025	Analyze loading conditions
Sheet 2: System-Level FMECA
This sheet analyzes an entire system, such as a boiler system. The structure is broader, focusing on subsystems.
Header Information (Top of the Sheet)
Field	Details
System Name	The name of the system (e.g., Boiler System).
Description	A short explanation of the system's purpose (e.g., Generates process steam).
Primary Function	The main function of the system (e.g., Provides heat and steam).
FMECA Table (Bottom of the Sheet)
Subsystem	Failure Mode	Cause	Effect	Severity	Probability	Detection	RPN	Action Required	Target Date	Comments/Notes
Burner	Flame failure	Blocked fuel nozzle	Loss of heat generation	9	4	3	108	Inspect and clean regularly	01-Jun-2025	Use automated flame monitoring
Gas System	Gas leakage	Valve seal degradation	Risk of explosion, hazard	10	3	5	150	Replace seals, add sensors	15-Jun-2025	Add auto shut-off for leaks
Automation & Control	System malfunction	Software bugs	Incorrect boiler operation	8	5	4	160	Update software regularly	10-Jul-2025	Perform regular validation
Key Points for Implementation
Tailoring the Columns: These columns can be adjusted to suit your specific needs—e.g., adding "Cost of Mitigation" or "Criticality Index" if required.
Linking Both Sheets: Ensure there's a clear link between systems and their assets for continuity (e.g., a pump in the boiler system should reference back to the larger system-level FMECA).
Additional Notes: Encourage stakeholders to use the comments column to capture insights during the analysis process.
