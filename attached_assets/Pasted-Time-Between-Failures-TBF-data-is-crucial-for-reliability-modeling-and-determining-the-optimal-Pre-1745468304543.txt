Time Between Failures (TBF) data is crucial for reliability modeling and determining the optimal Preventive Maintenance (PM) interval.

Why TBF Matters

TBF (or Time-to-Failure, TTF) is the primary input for:
Estimating Weibull parameters (β, η) or MTBF (if using exponential distribution).
Modeling failure trends (increasing/decreasing failure rates).
Without TBF data, you must rely on assumed failure distributions (less accurate).
How to Incorporate TBF into PM Optimization

Step 1: Collect & Analyze TBF Data

Gather historical failure times (e.g., [150 hrs, 450 hrs, 980 hrs, ...]).
If no failures, use accelerated life testing or industry benchmarks.
Step 2: Fit a Distribution (Weibull, Exponential, etc.)

Weibull Analysis:
Estimate shape (β) and scale (η) from TBF data (using MLE or regression).
Example: If β > 1, failures are wear-out related → PM is effective.
Exponential Model (if β ≈ 1):
Calculate MTBF = (Total Operational Time) / (Number of Failures).
Step 3: Use TBF Data in PM Optimization

Cost-Based Approach:
Total Cost = PM Cost (Cp) + Failure Cost (Cf) × Probability of Failure.
Optimize PM interval (t) to minimize:

Example with TBF Data

Given:

TBF dataset (hrs): [200, 500, 800, 1100, 1400]
Weibull parameters: β = 2.1, η = 1000 hrs
Costs: Cp = $300, Cf = $3000
Step 1: Fit Weibull to TBF data (if parameters unknown).
Step 2: Compute reliability at candidate PM intervals:

PM Interval (t)	Reliability R(t)	Cost Rate
400 hrs	0.92	$1.02/hr
600 hrs	0.83	$0.98/hr
800 hrs	0.70	$1.05/hr
Optimal PM Interval: ~600 hrs (minimizes cost rate).
Key Takeaways

TBF is essential for accurate reliability modeling.
Without TBF, you must assume β and η (higher uncertainty).
Combine TBF with cost/reliability targets to find the best PM interval.
