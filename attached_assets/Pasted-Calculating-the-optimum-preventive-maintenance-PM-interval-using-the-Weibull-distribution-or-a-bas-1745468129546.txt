Calculating the optimum preventive maintenance (PM) interval using the Weibull distribution or a basic reliability model involves analyzing failure data to minimize downtime, cost, or maximize reliability. Below is a step-by-step guide along with the required information.

1. Required Information

To model PM intervals, you need:

Failure Data (Time-to-Failure):
Historical failure times (e.g., hours, cycles, miles).
If no failures yet, use industry-standard Weibull parameters (β, η).
Weibull Parameters (if using Weibull analysis):
Shape Parameter (β): Indicates failure rate behavior:
β < 1: Decreasing failure rate (early failures).
β = 1: Constant failure rate (exponential distribution).
β > 1: Increasing failure rate (wear-out).
Scale Parameter (η): Characteristic life (time at which ~63.2% of units fail).
Cost & Downtime Data:
Cost of preventive maintenance (Cp).
Cost of corrective maintenance (Cf) (usually Cf >> Cp).
Downtime duration for PM vs. failure.
2. Steps to Calculate Optimum PM Interval

Method 1: Using Weibull Reliability Model

The Weibull reliability function is:

R
(
t
)
=
e
−
(
t
/
η
)
β
R(t)=e 
−(t/η) 
β
 
 
Optimal PM Interval (t) balances reliability and cost.

Approach 1: Cost Minimization

The optimal PM interval minimizes total cost per unit time:

Total Cost Rate

C
p
×
R
(
t
)
+
C
f
×
(

−
R
(
t
)
)
t
Total Cost Rate= 
t
Cp×R(t)+Cf×(1−R(t))
​	
 
Find 
t
t that minimizes this function (use numerical methods or optimization).
Approach 2: Reliability Threshold

Set PM interval at a time 
t
t where reliability drops below a threshold (e.g., 90%):

t
=
η

β
t=η×(−ln(R)) 
1/β
 
(Example: If 
R
=
0.90
R=0.90, 
t
=
η

(

ln

(
0.9
)
)

β
t=η×(−ln(0.9)) 
1/β
 )

Method 2: Using Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) - Exponential Model

If failure rate is constant (β ≈ 1), use exponential distribution:

λ
=
1
MTBF
λ= 
MTBF

Optimal PM interval can be derived from cost optimization:

3. Example Calculation (Weibull Model)

Assume:

Weibull parameters: β = 2.5, η = 1000 hrs
Costs: Cp = $500, Cf = $5000
Step 1: Find 
t
t that minimizes:

Cost Rate
=
500
×
e
−
(
t
/
1000
)
2.5
+
5000
×
(

(

)

)
t
Cost Rate= 
t
500×e 
−(t/1000) 
2.5
 
 +5000×(1−e 
−(t/1000) 
2.5
 
 )
​	
 
Step 2: Solve numerically (e.g., using Excel, Python):

Try 
t
=
600
t=600 hrs → Compute Cost Rate.
Try 
t
=
700
t=700 hrs → Compare.
Optimal 
t
t is where Cost Rate is lowest (e.g., ~650 hrs).
