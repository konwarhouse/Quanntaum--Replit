To build a flexible module that allows users to perform RAM (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability), RCM (Reliability-Centered Maintenance), and FMECA (Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis), here's how we can structure it, using the pump system example as a reference:
 
üîß Module Architecture Overview
1. Unified System Modeling Layer
Create a base structure where users define:

This becomes the shared input for RAM, RCM, and FMECA analyses.
 
2. Mode Selector Interface
‚Ä¢	Let the user choose:

‚Ä¢	Reduced flow: Flow rate drops below 95 gallons/minute.
‚Ä¢	Pressure deviation: Pressure outside 50‚Äì60 psi.
‚Ä¢	Excessive downtime: Availability < 98%.
Step 3: Failure Modes

Step 7: Default Actions

‚Ä¢	Bearing seizure: Maintain inventory of bearings.
‚Ä¢	Impeller erosion: Consider material upgrade if inspections show frequent issues.
‚Ä¢	Seal leakage: Develop spill containment plan for environmental compliance.
‚Ä¢	Control unit malfunction: Install redundant control unit for critical operations.
5. RAM Analysis Inputs
‚Ä¢	From FMECA:

o	MTTR: 4‚Äì8 hours depending on failure mode.
o	Criticality: Prioritize motor, bearings, seals.
‚Ä¢	From RCM:
o	Maintenance tasks: Reduce failure rates (e.g., lubrication reduces bearing failure by 50%).
o	Intervals: Weekly monitoring, 3-month lubrication, etc.
o	Default actions: Spare parts reduce MTTR.
‚Ä¢	RAM Metrics:
o	Reliability: Calculate MTBF based on adjusted failure rates.
