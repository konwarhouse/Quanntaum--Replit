The calculation of Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) using the Weibull distribution depends on its shape parameter (β). Unlike the exponential distribution (where MTBF = 1/λ), the Weibull MTBF requires integration of the reliability function and varies based on the failure pattern. Here's how it works:

Weibull MTBF Formula

The MTBF for a Weibull distribution is calculated using the gamma function (Γ):

MTBF
=
η
⋅
Γ
(
1
+
1
β
)
MTBF=η⋅Γ(1+ 
β
1
​	
 )
Where:

η (eta) = Scale parameter (characteristic life, where 63.2% of units fail).
β (beta) = Shape parameter (determines failure rate behavior):
β < 1: Decreasing failure rate (early failures).
β = 1: Constant failure rate (exponential distribution, MTBF = η).
β > 1: Increasing failure rate (wear-out failures).
Γ = Gamma function (available in Excel, Python, etc.).
Step-by-Step Calculation

1. Determine β and η

Estimate these from historical failure data using:
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), or
Weibull probability plotting (e.g., rank regression on failure times).
2. Compute Gamma Function

Use the gamma function for 
Γ
(
1
+
1
β
)
Γ(1+ 
β
1
​	
 ):

In Excel: =EXP(GAMMALN(1 + 1/β))
In Python: math.gamma(1 + 1/β)
3. Multiply by η

MTBF=η×Γ-result
Examples

Case 1: β = 1 (Exponential Distribution)

Γ
(
1
+
1
/
1
)
=
Γ
(
2
)
=
1
Γ(1+1/1)=Γ(2)=1
MTBF = η × 1 = η
*(Matches exponential distribution where MTBF = 1/λ)*.
Case 2: β = 2 (Increasing Failure Rate)

Γ
(
1
+
1
/
2
)
=
Γ
(
1.5
)
≈
0.8862
Γ(1+1/2)=Γ(1.5)≈0.8862
If η = 100 hours:
MTBF = 100 × 0.8862 ≈ 88.62 hours.
Case 3: β = 0.5 (Decreasing Failure Rate)

Γ
(
1
+
1
/
0.5
)
=
Γ
(
3
)
=
2
Γ(1+1/0.5)=Γ(3)=2
If η = 100 hours:
MTBF = 100 × 2 = 200 hours.
Key Notes

MTBF vs. MTTF:
For repairable systems, use MTBF.
For non-repairable systems, use MTTF (Mean Time To Failure). The calculation is identical for Weibull.
When β = 1:
Weibull reduces to exponential distribution, and MTBF = η = 1/λ.
Practical Implications:
β > 1: MTBF < η (failures occur faster as β increases).
β < 1: MTBF > η (longer average time between early failures).

MTBF		=B1*EXP(GAMMALN(1+1/B2))	88.62
Python Code

python
import math

def weibull_mtbf(eta, beta):
    return eta * math.gamma(1 + 1/beta)

# Example:
print(weibull_mtbf(100, 2))  # Output: 88.62
Why Gamma Function?

The gamma function generalizes factorials to non-integers and is needed to solve the integral of the Weibull reliability function over infinite time:

Common Mistakes

Assuming MTBF = η: Only true if β = 1.
Ignoring β: Using exponential formulas when β ≠ 1 leads to errors.
Units: Ensure η and MTBF use consistent units (hours, days, etc.).
